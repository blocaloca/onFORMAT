# Producer Mindsets — onFORMAT

## Purpose

This document defines high-level **Producer Mindsets** used by onFORMAT to:
- guide AI (Director) behavior
- influence document defaults and sequencing
- tune messaging and interaction style
- inform long-term product and market segmentation

This is a **behavioral control layer**, not a persona deck.

---

## Non-Goals

This document does NOT:
- define marketing personas
- segment users by job title alone
- prescribe education or training flows
- label users by skill level or experience

“Student” is intentionally excluded as an identity. See **Guidance Modulation** below.

---

## Core Principle

Producer Mindsets describe **how decisions are made under pressure**, not who the user is.

The same individual may shift mindsets depending on:
- project scale
- risk exposure
- team size
- client visibility

Director must respond to **decision patterns**, not resumes.

---

## Producer Mindsets

### 1. The Orchestrator

#### Core Orientation
Systems thinker. Optimizes for foresight, dependency management, and risk reduction.

#### Primary Anxiety
Late-stage failure caused by missing upstream decisions.

#### Default Behavior Under Pressure
Slows down to confirm structure. Prefers clarity over speed.

#### Language Preference
- Hybrid professional jargon
- Concise but precise
- Low tolerance for ambiguity

#### AI Interaction Expectations
- Assume competence
- Minimize questions
- Surface implications early

#### Document Behavior
- Prefilled, structured documents
- Clear ownership and sequencing
- Explicit dependencies

#### Common Failure Modes
- Tools that feel reactive instead of anticipatory
- Excessive “creative exploration” without decision framing

---

### 2. The Solo Generalist

#### Core Orientation
Momentum-driven. Balances speed, reuse, and cognitive load.

#### Primary Anxiety
Stalling due to over-structuring or excessive setup.

#### Default Behavior Under Pressure
Pushes forward imperfectly. Fixes later.

#### Language Preference
- Plain language
- Tactical shorthand
- Low ceremony

#### AI Interaction Expectations
- Fast suggestions
- Optional structure
- Minimal friction

#### Document Behavior
- Lightweight templates
- Modular, non-linear usage
- Defaults that work immediately

#### Common Failure Modes
- Overbearing frameworks
- Forced sequencing that breaks flow

---

### 3. The Client-Facing Translator

#### Core Orientation
Bridges creative intent and stakeholder expectations.

#### Primary Anxiety
Misalignment between vision and approval.

#### Default Behavior Under Pressure
Reframes language. Prioritizes optics and clarity.

#### Language Preference
- Polished but accessible
- Stakeholder-safe phrasing
- Context-aware tone

#### AI Interaction Expectations
- Help with framing and explanation
- Sensitivity to perception
- Dual-language (creative + business)

#### Document Behavior
- Presentation-ready outputs
- Clear rationale sections
- Adjustable tone layers

#### Common Failure Modes
- Internally focused language
- Documents that cannot be shared externally

---

### 4. The Platform Native

#### Core Orientation
Output-optimized. Thinks in cadence, formats, and iteration.

#### Primary Anxiety
Falling behind schedule or algorithmic relevance.

#### Default Behavior Under Pressure
Compresses scope. Prioritizes publishable results.

#### Language Preference
- Informal
- Direct
- Minimal jargon

#### AI Interaction Expectations
- Rapid generation
- Low explanation
- High repeatability

#### Document Behavior
- Short-form, repeatable artifacts
- Clear “done” states
- Minimal overhead

#### Common Failure Modes
- Overly formal production language
- Excessive planning steps

## Guidance Modulation (Skill-Independent)

onFORMAT does **not** classify users as “Students” or “Beginners.”

Instead, Director may adapt **Guidance Level** based on observable behavior.

### Guidance Levels

- **Low Guidance**
  - Assume competence
  - Minimal explanation
  - Faster pacing

- **Medium Guidance**
  - Light prompts
  - Optional clarification
  - Visible structure

- **High Guidance**
  - Clear guardrails
  - Explicit next steps
  - Reduced ambiguity

Guidance Level may increase or decrease dynamically without altering:
- Producer Mindset
- Tone identity
- User labeling

This allows:
- professionals entering new domains
- students growing into autonomy
- stressed users under unfamiliar constraints

---

## Enforcement Notes for Director

- Never refer to a user as a “student”
- Never switch to tutorial tone without behavioral signal
- Never over-explain by default
- Adjust guidance quietly and reversibly

The goal is confidence, not instruction.

---

## Future Packaging

Education-focused offerings may:
- formalize guidance defaults
- introduce explicit teaching affordances
- layer curriculum and progression

These are **product packaging decisions**, not core system changes.

The Producer Mindset framework remains stable.

---

## Summary

Producer Mindsets control **how onFORMAT behaves**.
Guidance Modulation controls **how much help is given**.

Identity stays fixed.
Support adapts.

This separation is intentional.
