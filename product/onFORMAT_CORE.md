# onFORMAT — Core Product Definition

## What onFORMAT Is

onFORMAT is a production-first operating system for modern content creation.

It helps producers, photographers, videographers, and content creators
organize, plan, and execute real-world creative projects using familiar,
industry-standard documents enhanced by AI assistance.

onFORMAT prioritizes clarity, decision-making, and production readiness
over inspiration, speculation, or generative novelty.

## Primary Users

- Producers (primary)
- Photographers
- Videographers
- Hybrid content creators (photo + video + social)

Secondary users may include assistants and collaborators, but the system
is designed around producer logic and accountability.

## Core Principles

1. Production-first, not AI-first  
   onFORMAT supports real production workflows. AI assists but does not
   invent reality.

2. Familiar documents, better organized  
   Users should instantly recognize documents such as briefs, budgets,
   call sheets, and shot lists.

3. Decision-making artifacts  
   Each document exists to help a producer make or validate decisions.

4. Light interaction, high leverage  
   AI should reduce friction, not increase cognitive load.

5. Guardrails over creativity  
   onFORMAT avoids hallucination-heavy outputs that could cause
   production, legal, or safety issues.

## What onFORMAT Does NOT Do

- It does not pretend to be a local fixer, scout, or agent.
- It does not invent locations, talent, pricing, or legal requirements.
- It does not generate speculative creative treatments by default.
- It is not a prompt marketplace or AI art generator.

## AI Role

AI in onFORMAT acts as a collaborator that:

- Asks clarifying questions
- Structures information
- Surfaces risks, gaps, and dependencies
- Helps generate clean, usable documents

AI does not replace professional judgment.

---

## Output Rules

- Primary outputs are PDFs.
- Structured data and exports may be introduced in later versions.
- Documents must remain production-usable outside the app.

---

## Product Direction

onFORMAT aims to feel like a professional tool:
precise, calm, and trustworthy.

If a feature adds confusion or spectacle at the expense of clarity,
it does not belong in v1.
