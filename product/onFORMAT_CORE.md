# onFORMAT — Core Product Definition

## What onFORMAT Is

onFORMAT is a production-first operating system for modern content creation.

It helps producers, photographers, videographers, and content creators
organize, plan, and execute real-world creative projects using familiar,
industry-standard documents enhanced by AI assistance.

onFORMAT prioritizes clarity, decision-making, and production readiness
over inspiration, speculation, or generative novelty.

## Primary Users

- Producers (primary)
- Photographers
- Videographers
- Hybrid content creators (photo + video + social)

Secondary users may include assistants and collaborators, but the system
is designed around producer logic and accountability.

## Core Principles

1. Production-first, not AI-first  
   onFORMAT supports real production workflows. AI assists but does not
   invent reality.

2. Familiar documents, better organized  
   Users should instantly recognize documents such as briefs, budgets,
   call sheets, and shot lists.

3. Decision-making artifacts  
   Each document exists to help a producer make or validate decisions.

4. Light interaction, high leverage  
   AI should reduce friction, not increase cognitive load.

5. Guardrails over creativity  
   onFORMAT avoids hallucination-heavy outputs that could cause
   production, legal, or safety issues.

## What onFORMAT Does NOT Do

- It does not pretend to be a local fixer, scout, or agent.
- It does not invent locations, talent, pricing, or legal requirements.
- It does not generate speculative creative treatments by default.
- It is not a prompt marketplace or AI art generator.

## onSET Mobile & Security
Mobile is not just a viewport; it is a secure "Utility Belt" for active production.

### The "Gatekeeper" Model
1.  **Project Access**: Crew join via a signed QR code generated by the Producer in `Mobile Control`.
2.  **Identity**: Users must authenticate via email to enter.
3.  **NDA Overlay**: Before viewing any documents, users must accept the Production NDA (non-negotiable).
4.  **Role-Based Views**:
    - **Crew**: See Call Sheet + Safety.
    - **Keys**: See Dept Docs + Reports.
    - **Admins**: See All + Live Tools.

### Live Production Features
- **Real-Time Sync**: Changes on Desktop (e.g., Schedule update) push instantly to all connected devices.
- **Media Alerts**: When a Camera Loader logs a "New Roll" on mobile, the DIT Station on desktop receives an instant "Ingest Ready" notification.
- **Offline-First**: Critical data (Call Sheet, Contacts) is cached for dead zones.

### Post-Production
- **Deliverables & Licensing**
- **Archive Log**

Documents outside this set are deprecated or future-facing.

## AI Role & Modes

AI behavior transitions based on the user's intent:

### 🔴 OFF (Passive Indexing)
The system is standard software. AI is disconnected but indexing data (e.g., Shoot Dates, Cast Names) in the background to build context.

### 🟡 ASSIST (The Librarian)
- **Role**: Validation, Consistency, Data Entry.
- **Behavior**: Reactive and deterministic. "Fill this schedule based on the script."
- **Guardrails**: No creative hallucination. Temperature 0.

### 🟢 DEVELOP (The Partner)
- **Role**: Ideation, Strategy, Problem Solving.
- **Behavior**: Proactive and creative. "How can we shoot this scene for less money?"
- **Capabilities**: Web Search, Image Gen, Narrative drafting.

## Output Rules

- Primary outputs are PDFs.
- Structured data and exports may be introduced in later versions.
- Documents must remain production-usable outside the app.

## Product Direction

onFORMAT aims to feel like a professional tool:
precise, calm, and trustworthy.

If a feature adds confusion or spectacle at the expense of clarity,
it does not belong in v1.
