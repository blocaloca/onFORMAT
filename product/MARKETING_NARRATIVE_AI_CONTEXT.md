## The Sell (Emotional/Benefit Driven)
**Meet the First "Project-Aware" AI.**

Most AI tools are blank slates—brilliant, but amnesiac. You have to re-explain your film's tone, genre, and goals every time you open a new chat. **onFORMAT** changes the conversation. Because our Intelligence Layer is mapped directly to your project's DNA, it enters every room already briefed. When you ask for a shot list, it doesn't just offer generic camera angles; it suggests shots that reinforce the **mood** you defined in development. When you draft a schedule, it optimizes for the **priorities** you set in your brief. It’s the difference between hiring a freelancer for a day and working with a producing partner who has been with you since the first draft. It doesn’t just help you work faster; it helps you stay true to your vision, from the first spark to the final cut.

## The Info (Technical/Functional Driven)
**Smart Context: High-Impact Intelligence, Low-Token Cost.**

We believe AI should be a precision instrument, not a blunt force. That’s why **onFORMAT** utilizes a proprietary "Intent-Aware" data architecture. Instead of flooding the model with irrelevant data—wasting tokens and confusing the output—we selectively inject the critical "Project Intent" (your Vision, Brief, and Tone) into the AI's context window for every creative task. Meanwhile, purely logistical data transfers (like moving budget items to actuals) are handled by efficient, token-free database logic.

This Hybrid Architecture gives you the best of both worlds:
*   **Deep Alignment:** The AI always "knows" what kind of film you are making.
*   **Maximum Efficiency:** You never pay AI costs for simple data entry tasks.
*   **Contextual Focus:** The AI adapts its persona automatically—acting as a Creative Director in development and a Line Producer in execution—without you ever having to flip a switch.
