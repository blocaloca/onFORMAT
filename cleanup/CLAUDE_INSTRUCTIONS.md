You are assisting with refactoring and cleanup of an existing Next.js product.

Your rules:

1. onFORMAT_CORE.md is the source of truth.
   If any existing feature, document, or UI element conflicts with it, flag it.

2. Do not invent new features.
   Only reorganize, rename, merge, or deprecate existing ones.

3. Never delete files without explicit instruction.
   Use comments or deprecation notes instead.

4. Favor clarity over cleverness.
   Fewer documents, clearer names, stronger hierarchy.

5. AI behavior must remain production-first, not creative-first.

6. If unsure, stop and explain tradeoffs instead of guessing.
